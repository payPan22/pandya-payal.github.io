            <p>Hey there! I’m Payal, a Senior Software Engineer passionate about crafting smooth, scalable, and intuitive user experiences. I’ve helped build front-end systems for everything from analytics dashboards to visualization tools, turning complex data into clean, human-centered interfaces.
